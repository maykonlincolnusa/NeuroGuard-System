## Features
- EEG preprocessing (EDF)
- Feature extraction
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning models
- Secure data anonymization
- API for integration with clinical systems

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, MNE
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Flask or FastAPI
- Cryptography

## Dataset
- CHB-MIT EEG Dataset (public)

## Disclaimer
⚠️ This system is a research support tool and **not a medical diagnostic device**.
Clinical decisions must always be made by licensed professionals.
